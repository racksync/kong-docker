## Deploy Kong step by step

### Deploy kong-database

```
docker-compose up -d kong-database
```

### Run kong-database migrations

```
docker-compose run --rm kong-migrations
```

### Start Kong

```
docker-compose up -d kong
```

**Now Kong is running**

- Kong Admin API http://127.0.0.1:8001
- Kong Proxy http://127.0.0.1:8000

### Explanation of Dependency Flow

- `kong-database` is foundational because both `kong-migrations` and `kong` rely on the database to function.
- `kong-migrations` ensures the database is initialized and ready for use by Kong.
- `kong` is the last to start, as it requires the database and migrations to be fully prepared.

By setting `depends_on`, Docker Compose handles these dependencies automatically, starting the containers in the correct order as long as all services are defined in the same file and executed using `docker-compose up`. However, note that `depends_on` only checks if a container starts, not if it is fully ready, so the health checks ensure readiness.

### Upgrading Kong version

> **WARNING** : This may take some downtime to start a new Kong version.

1. Change `KONG_VERSION` in `.env` file to a newer version.

	> If running kong version 2.2 change to 2.3 (or 2.3.0). [Suggested upgrade path](https://github.com/Kong/kong/blob/master/UPGRADE.md)

2. Run migrations upgrade

	```
	docker-compose run --rm kong kong migrations up --vv
	```

3. Confirm finish migrations upgrade

	```
	docker-compose run --rm kong kong migrations finish --vv
	```
	
4. Start new Kong version

	```
	docker-compose up -d kong
	```
